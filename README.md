# EDA-project

In this project, you will use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

Prepare for this project with: Data Analysis with R.

What will I learn?
After completing the project, you will:

Understand the distribution of a variable and to check for anomalies and outliers
Learn how to quantify and visualize individual variables within a data set by using appropriate plots such as scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, and box plots
Explore variables to identify the most important variables and relationships within a data set before building predictive models; calculate correlations, and investigate conditional means
Learn powerful methods and visualizations for examining relationships among multiple variables, such as reshaping data frames and using aesthetics like color and shape to uncover more information
